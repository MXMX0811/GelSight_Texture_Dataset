            "2": "The surface texture shown in the image is a combination of roughness and fine graininess. The macroscopic structure consists of a patterned ridges and grooves, giving the surface a slightly uneven appearance. The microscopic structure features tiny granules, which give the surface a slightly fuzzy and porous feel. Based on the material, the tactile impression is that of a soft and slightly rigid surface.",
            "3": "The surface texture in the image is rough and has a grainy texture. The microscopic structure consists of tiny granules, giving the surface a granular feel. The surface is also slightly porous, making it feel slightly textured. Based on the material, it can be inferred that the surface is rigid.",
            "4": "The surface texture in the image is rough and has a grainy texture. The microscopic structure consists of tiny granules, giving the surface a fuzzy feel. The surface is also porous, making it feel slightly rough to the touch. Based on the material, it can be inferred that the surface is soft and rigid at the same time.",
            "5": "The surface texture in the image is rough and has a grainy texture. The microscopic structure consists of tiny granules, giving the surface a granular feel. The surface is also prickly to the touch. Based on the material, it can be inferred that the surface is rigid."

            "1": "The surface texture appears to be relatively coarse, characterized by a speckled pattern with small, dark spots distributed throughout. The macroscopic structure is uniform across the image, suggesting a consistent material without any significant variations in height or depth. Microscopically, the texture seems to consist of tiny granules or specks that give it a slightly rough feel. This tactile impression might suggest a material like granite or a similar stone, which typically has a coarse and uneven surface due to its natural formation process. Overall, the surface could be described as having a gritty, grainy tactile quality that would likely feel firm but not smooth under the fingers.",
            "2": "The surface texture in the image appears to be granular, with a roughness level that could be described as grainy. There is no distinct macroscopic structure such as ridges or grooves; instead, the pattern seems uniform across the visible area. The microscopic structure consists of tiny, dark speckles distributed throughout the lighter background, giving it a speckled appearance. This type of texture would likely convey a tactile impression of being coarse and uneven due to the presence of these small granules.",
            "3": "The surface texture in the image appears to be grainy. The granules are irregularly distributed, suggesting a rough tactile quality. There is no clear pattern or repetition in the texture, which could indicate a natural or artificial material with an uneven surface. The macroscopic structure seems uniform across the visible area, without any discernible ridges, grooves, or undulations. The microscopic structure consists of small, uniformly sized granules that contribute to the overall grainy feel. Based on these observations, the inferred tactile impression would likely be one of a firm and coarse texture, possibly resembling materials like sandpaper or a finely ground stone.",
            "4": "The surface texture depicted in the image appears to be rough with a granular feel. The macroscopic structure is characterized by small, irregularly distributed dark speckles on a lighter background, suggesting a patterned appearance without any pronounced ridges or grooves. Microscopically, the texture seems to consist of tiny granules, giving it a slightly fuzzy and uneven tactile impression. This type of texture could be inferred as being rigid rather than soft due to the visible granularity and lack of smoothness.",
            "5": "The surface texture depicted in the image appears to be quite uniform and lacks significant variations. It has a granular appearance, suggesting that it might have tiny granules or speckles distributed across its entirety. This type of texture could provide a slight tactile sensation due to the irregularities caused by the granules. The macroscopic structure is consistent throughout, with no discernible patterned ridges, grooves, or undulations. Microscopically, the surface seems to have a rough feel due to the presence of these small particles. Overall, the inferred tactile impression would likely be that of a coarse, rigid material rather than soft or flexible."
