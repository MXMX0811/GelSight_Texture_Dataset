            "4": "The surface texture in the image is rough and granular, with a macroscopic structure consisting of small, round bumps that are evenly spaced apart. The microscopic structure consists of tiny, white granules that are densely packed together, giving the surface a fuzzy texture. The overall tactile impression is soft and slightly rough.",
            "5": "The surface texture in the image is grainy and has a roughness level of fine. The microscopic structure consists of tiny granules, giving the surface a fuzzy texture. The macroscopic structure features a pattern of ridges and valleys, which can be felt through tactile perception. Based on the material, it can be inferred that the surface is soft to the touch."

            "1": "The surface texture in the image appears to be fine and slightly rough. The material has a consistent pattern with small, raised areas that give it a somewhat grainy feel. There are no pronounced macroscopic structures such as ridges or grooves, but rather a uniform, even texture throughout. Microscopically, the surface may have tiny granules or fuzziness due to the visible variations in height, suggesting a soft, possibly plush tactile impression. This type of texture might be associated with materials like felted wool or synthetic fibers designed for comfort and warmth.",
            "2": "The surface texture in the image appears to be quite rough, characterized by a granular feel with small, raised bumps that give it a coarse tactile impression. The macroscopic structure shows a consistent pattern of these bumps across the fabric, suggesting a regular weaving or knitting technique. There are no significant undulations or grooves visible, indicating a uniform and stable texture throughout. This type of texture might be associated with materials like wool or a similar natural fiber, which often have a fuzzy or soft touch despite their rough appearance. Overall, the tactile impression one would get from this material is likely to be slightly abrasive but warm due to the potential for insulation provided by such fibers.",
            "3": "The surface texture depicted in the image appears to be relatively coarse, with a grainy feel that suggests it may have a roughness level akin to sandpaper. The macroscopic structure is characterized by a series of interlocking loops or stitches, which create a patterned ridged effect across the surface. These loops are not uniform but vary slightly in size and shape, contributing to an uneven tactile impression. Microscopically, one might infer the presence of tiny granules or fibers, giving the material a fuzzy quality. The overall tactile impression could be described as soft due to the looped structure, yet the individual loops provide a slight resistance upon touch, indicating a balance between softness and slight rigidity. This combination of characteristics would likely result in a unique sensory experience when touched, where the initial softness is interrupted by the occasional prickly sensation from the raised loops.",
            "4": "The surface texture depicted in the image exhibits a fine, granular tactile characteristic. The roughness level is moderate, with small granules creating a slightly uneven surface. Macroscopically, there are visible patterns that resemble raised ridges and grooves, contributing to a textured feel. Microscopically, the granularity suggests a fuzzy or fuzzy-like quality, indicating a soft but not overly plush material. The inferred tactile impression would likely be one of gentle softness, possibly resembling felt or a similar fabric with a subtle texture.",
            "5": "The surface texture in the image appears to be relatively rough, characterized by a granular feel. The macroscopic structure is consistent with a patterned ridging that could provide tactile feedback through raised and recessed areas. These patterns suggest a possible woven or knitted material, which typically offers a combination of both smooth and grainy textures depending on how the weave is constructed. Microscopically, one might infer tiny fibers or threads contributing to the overall texture, possibly giving it a slightly fuzzy sensation. Considering these characteristics, the inferred tactile impression would likely be soft but with a slight graininess due to the repetitive pattern."
