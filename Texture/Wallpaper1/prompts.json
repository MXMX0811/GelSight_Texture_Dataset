            "1": "The surface texture in the image is rough and has a granular feel. The microscopic structure consists of small bumps on the surface, giving it a fuzzy texture. The texture is also porous, with small holes visible under the surface. Based on the material, it feels soft to the touch.",
            "2": "The surface texture in the image is rough and has a grainy appearance. The microscopic structure consists of tiny granules, giving the surface a porous feel. The tactile impression is that of a rigid material.",
            "3": "The surface texture in the image is rough and has a grainy macroscopic structure. The microscopic structure consists of tiny granules, giving the surface a textured and granular feel. The tactile impression is that of a rigid material.",
            "4": "The surface texture in the image is rough and granular, with a microscopic structure that includes tiny white granules. The tactile impression is soft and porous, with a fuzzy feel. The roughness level is medium, with a moderate amount of texture. The macroscopic structure consists of uneven ridges and valleys, giving the surface a slightly undulating appearance.",
            "5": "The surface texture in the image is rough and grainy, with a microscopic structure consisting of tiny granules. The texture feels porous and has a fuzzy texture. The tactile impression is that of a soft material."

            "1": "The surface texture in the image appears to be quite rough, characterized by a grainy feel. The macroscopic structure is consistent with a woven or knitted fabric, displaying a uniform pattern of interlaced threads. This suggests a tactile impression that could be described as coarse and slightly abrasive. Microscopically, one might infer the presence of tiny granules or fibers that contribute to the overall roughness. Given these characteristics, the material would likely have a soft yet firm sensation when touched, possibly yielding to pressure but not being overly flexible.",
            "2": "The surface texture in the image appears to be relatively rough, with a granular and slightly uneven appearance. The macroscopic structure consists of small, irregularly shaped protrusions that create a somewhat bumpy surface. These protrusions are distributed evenly across the visible area, suggesting a consistent texture throughout. The microscopic structure is not distinctly visible due to the resolution of the image; however, there may be tiny granules or a slight fuzziness contributing to the overall tactile impression. Based on these characteristics, the inferred tactile impression would likely be one of softness, as the surface does not seem to have any sharp edges or hard ridges that would suggest a rigid feel.",
            "3": "The surface texture appears to be relatively smooth with a fine, even weave. There are no pronounced macroscopic structures such as ridges or grooves visible at this scale. The microscopic structure seems to consist of tiny granules that could contribute to a soft and slightly fuzzy tactile impression. This type of texture might feel comfortable against the skin but not overly plush due to its fine graininess. The overall impression is one of a fabric material that would provide a gentle touch without being abrasive.",
            "4": "The surface texture appears to be rough, with a fine grainy feel. The macroscopic structure consists of small, uniform, interconnected squares or diamond shapes that create a consistent pattern across the surface. These patterns give the impression of a woven fabric, which could suggest a soft yet sturdy tactile experience. Due to the close-up nature of the image and lack of visible irregularities such as protrusions or depressions, it is likely that the material has a uniform texture throughout.",
            "5": "The surface texture in the image appears to be rough with a grainy tactile characteristic. The macroscopic structure is characterized by a patterned grid-like formation, suggesting a woven or knitted fabric. This kind of texture typically feels uneven due to the interlacing threads, which could give a sense of ridges and grooves when touched. Microscopically, there may be tiny granules or fibers that contribute to the fuzziness, adding to the overall roughness. Given these characteristics, the material likely has a soft but textured feel, possibly resembling felt or a similar type of fabric."
